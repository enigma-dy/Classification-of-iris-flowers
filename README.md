Classification of iris flowers. The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) from the sepals' and petals' length and width measurements. Here, we design a model that makes proper classifications for new flowers
Steps:

Data Collection:

Obtain the Iris dataset, which is readily available in various machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or online repositories.
Data Exploration:

Explore the dataset to understand its structure, size, and features.
Visualize the data distribution and relationships between different features.
Check for any missing or inconsistent values.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing or inconsistent data if any.
Encode categorical variables (if needed).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Selection:

Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for classification, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, or K-Nearest Neighbors.
Implement multiple models and compare their performance.
Model Training:

Train the selected models using the training dataset.
Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using the testing dataset.
Measure and compare performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualize the confusion matrix to understand model strengths and weaknesses.
Model Deployment (Optional):

If applicable, deploy the trained model in a production environment.
Implement a simple user interface for users to input iris measurements and receive predictions.
